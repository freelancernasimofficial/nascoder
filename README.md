You: "Hey NasCoder, create a React app with authentication and deploy it to AWS"

NasCoder: I'll help you build and deploy that React app! Let me break this down:
1. Creating React app with Vite...
2. Setting up authentication with Auth0...
3. Configuring AWS deployment pipeline...
4. Would you like me to open the browser and register the domain too?

You: "Yes, and also fill out the SSL certificate form"

NasCoder: Perfect! Opening browser, navigating to certificate authority, 
filling forms with your project details, and configuring auto-renewal.
Your app will be live in 3 minutes with full HTTPS! 🚀
